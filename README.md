# KATA
This short and simple Kata should be performed using Test Driven Development (TDD).

There is a series of books about software development that have been read by a lot of developers who want to improve their development skills. Letâ€™s say an editor, in a gesture of immense generosity to mankind (and to increase sales as well), is willing to set up a pricing model where you can get discounts when you buy these books. The available books are :

    Clean Code (Robert Martin, 2008)
    The Clean Coder (Robert Martin, 2011)
    Clean Architecture (Robert Martin, 2017)
    Test Driven Development by Example (Kent Beck, 2003)
    Working Effectively With Legacy Code (Michael C. Feathers, 2004)
